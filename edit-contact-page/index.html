<strong>Subject:</strong> <em>URGENT</em> Customer Service team is FREAKING OUT!

The web development team went to Lake Tahoe after they released the
latest code for our contact page.

It looks fantastic to me but the customer service department is
freaking out and they are champing at the bit for some tweaks to get
in place while the web team is away.

I'm sending you the contact page (contact.html) along with the static
folder needed to go with it. You don't need to do anything special to open
and view it, just open the file in a browser.

The CS team has listed out the problems they're getting calls about
below:

* The subtitle is a little intimidating
* People are complaining the headers seem to be yelling
* The new logo image in static needs to replace the old one
* The product line seems limited
* The email address isn't click-able

I have also, personally, included some suggestions to help alleviate
the problems:

* Come up with a temporary subtitle that's less aggressive.
* Change the headers to be less &quot;loud&quot;
* Change the logo being used from rsz_logo.jpg to new_logo.png
* Add 2 more pictures of melons to the carousel. I found more I liked;
  they're in the static/img folder.
* Wrap email address on bottom of the page in a link tag

Thanks for your help!!!
