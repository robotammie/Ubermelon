<strong>Subject:</strong> <em>SUPER URGENT</em> This trend will make us rich!

Hey,

We've been really impressed how you handed all the melons in your python server.
We don't understand all the details, but it appears that you can make magic!

Therefore we feel you need a better challenge. We have been reading all about the
&quot;thick client&quot; being the trend, which means shifting as much code &quot;work&quot; to the
client browser (not the server). Although we don't really know what this means,
we are sure you will be able to make it happen and make us rich.

To start with, can you please look at this old melon counting python script (seeing
how many melons you have added to your shopping cart). Since it's server side
python -- it must be so last year! Can you re-write this as a javascript function?

We have heard that you can write javscript in your text editor (some sublime thingy),
and then copy/paste the function into your browser's console. Then call the function,
feeding in the arguements (your list of melons).

Let us know as soon as you are ready to implement our future.
(And my summer retreat needs a sauna upgrade. So last year.)


Thanks,
Mel
Team Lead

<p><strong>Hint 1:</strong> Javascript has data structures analogous to lists and dictionaries.</p>
<p><strong>Hint 2:</strong> Mel doesn't really make great engineering design decisions. This is not the
way a shopping cart should be done. However, you need that bonus for your Halloween costume.</p>
